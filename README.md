# Mobile-price-Range
All the costumers are first worried and thinks “If he would be able to purchase something with given specifications or not”. Mobile now a days is one of the most selling and purchasing device. Every day new mobiles with new version and more features are launched. Hundreds and thousands of mobile are sold and purchased on daily basis. So we have to predict the price range of the Mobile based on features provided to us. So firstly we did exploratory data analysis on our data set. During the EDA we see that our dataset is highly balanced and there is no issue of multicollinearity. And there is also no issue of Null values  in our dataset. As all the colums are relevant so we are not dropping any feature from our data for further analysis. 
We have applied logistic Regression, K Nearest Neighbor, Decision Trees, random Forest , and Gradient boosting Machine learning algorithm to our dataset. And com to a conclusion that KNN is the best suited algothim for our case with highest accuracy of 94.5 % followed by Gradient Boosting algorithm.
